This is the *Simple Stopwatch* project I made myself.

The Simple Stopwatch project is a web application which allows users to time events with precision, offering features like start, stop, reset, and lap time recording. Built an interface that can display elapsed time prominently and provides buttons for easy control. With this project, users can track multiple laps, making it ideal for fitness routines, sports events, or any timing needs.
